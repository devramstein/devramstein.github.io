## Our Current Projects
  
### Ramstein Dorm App
Ramstein Dorms provides Ramstein AB and Kapaun AS dorm residents with a convenient and reliable method to contact the DRC, submit work orders, and be up-to-date with any dorm related issues. One of the problems that we are facing is that airmen are not reporting dorms issues to the DRC in a timely manner, by providing this app, airmen will be able to describe their problem with a push of a button.
